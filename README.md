# Machine-Learning
There are some ML algorithms
**Decision Tree** - Classifier to clasify objects.As test here I use Iris data.You can also test it for Regression.I implemented with gini,entropy and MSE

**KNN** - Finds nearest neghbour for current element. Test on MNSIT
**Neural Network** - To Classify Mnist data
